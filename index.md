This course introduces the theoretical foundations and practical methods of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Students will learn how machines process and understand human language, beginning with linguistic and statistical foundations, progressing through traditional machine learning approaches, and culminating in modern deep learning techniques including transformers and large language models (LLMs). The course also addresses evaluation, bias, fairness, and responsible NLP.

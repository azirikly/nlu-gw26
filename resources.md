## Paper presentations details and signup
We will use the following [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lEqBHbOeBPB_fqHuqNmTzBMYt8EY7wGAZYsaO-7H8Lc/edit?usp=sharing) for paper presentations signup 
Some comments about project presentation requirements
- Each should present twice this semester
- Each presentation lasts 20-25 minutes
- There are 4 papers, we would need 4 volunteers each week.
- Suggested guidelines for presentation - please keep in mind these are suggestions, but you are the leader of this and can evaluate what is important and what is not.
    - Background and any foundational concepts that are missing
    - Motivation
    - Models
    - Evaluation
    - Lessons learned
    - Project ideas even if you don't want to pursue them
- Questions you had for all of us

If you prefer another paper to present that you came across related to the topic, please check with me and most likely you will be able to present it. If there is a different topic that you would like to present on, please suggest it and we can add it to the weekly materials.

``` This is a learning process, and we'll all adapt throughout the class. The key is for you to try your best: read the paper, understand it, make it accessible and understandable to others, and bring interesting questions to the discussion.```
